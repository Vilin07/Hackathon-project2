        <h3 id="h3">Shri Mahila Griha Udyog - Lijjat Papad </h3>
        <p id="p">When 7 ladies from a building gathered on a terrace in Girgaon, Southern Mumbai, they gave birth to a new concept of entrepreneurship - Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad. It is a women's organization manufacturing various products from Papad, Appalam, Masala, etc. 

          Started by Jaswantiben Jamnadas Popat, Parvatiben Ramdas Thodani, Diwaliben Lukkha, Banuben N. Tanna, Ujamben Narandas Kundalia, Jayaben V. Vithalani and Laguben Amritlar Gokani in 1959, today this women’s group has become the undisputed market leader with more than 50% market share in India. They are 10 times larger than the 2nd largest papad brand in the country. 
          
          This women rural entrepreneur's success story is a reminder that when you put your heart and efforts into your idea, everything is possible. They had an annual turnover of Rs 1600 crores in 2019, and a 2001 data says they employ over 45,000 women across India.  </p>

   <h3 id="h3">Kanika Talukar, Founder Jay Vermi Compost</h3>
   <p id="p">When life threw tragedy at Kanika, she decided to rise from the ashes. Widowed at 27 with the responsibility of a 4-month-old daughter, Kanika decided not to bow down to tragedy. Instead, she learned how to do vermicompost in her hometown Nalbari, Assam.

     With just Rs 500 and 1 kg of earthworms, she started her own venture Jay Vermi Compost. She used locally sourced paddy residue, stems of hyacinth, cow dung, and bamboo pit for her organic vermicompost business. This woman rural entrepreneur today has a month income of Rs 3.5 lakh and sells her products on Amazon, Flipkart for consumers and to various farmers in the eastern region. 
     
     As India develops, encouraging women rural entrepreneurs will not only boost the country's economy but also build a more cohesive and powerful society. We can enable these amazing women entrepreneurs  to rewrite their own histories and serve as role models for future generations by giving them access to market opportunities, financial resources, and training. Huts and Looms salutes these fearless women who are changing the lives of innumerable other women by providing direction and employment.  </p>

        <h3 id="h3">Bina Devi - The Mushroom Lady from Bihar
        </h3>
        <p id="p">Bina Devi, 46 from Munger, Bihar is known as The Mushroom Lady or ‘Mushroom Mahila. As a woman from a village Bina Devi was tied down with the responsibilities of the house, kids, family, and the usual duties of rural women. However, the brave lady learned mushroom cultivation and grew her first batch under her bed due to a lack of place for cultivation. 

          Once she mastered the art of growing mushrooms, she began inspiring other women to take charge and achieve self-determination. In Munger district of Bihar, she has popularized the production of mushrooms in 105 nearby villages, inspiring 1,500 women to start growing mushrooms, gaining her the title ‘The Mushroom Lady’. 
          
          On March 9, 2020, President Ram Nath Kovind honored Bina Devi with the Nari Shakti Samman for her outstanding contribution to the agriculture sector. </p>
