            <h2>About Self-Reliance & Entrepreneurship</h2>
            <p>
                Self-Reliance & Entrepreneurship is designed to ignite the entrepreneurial spirit within rural girls and women, helping them build sustainable livelihoods with confidence and independence. This module introduces participants to the fundamentals of self-employment, financial literacy, and small business development. Learners explore local market opportunities, understand how to create and manage a business plan, and gain insights into pricing, promotion, and customer engagement. The module also covers essential skills such as budgeting, saving, accessing microloans, and leveraging government schemes that support women entrepreneurs.

                Participants are introduced to real-life success stories of women from rural communities who have transformed their ideas into thriving businesses, from tailoring and handicrafts to digital services and home-based enterprises. Workshops on product development, branding, and online selling help them modernize traditional skills and tap into wider markets, including e-commerce platforms.
